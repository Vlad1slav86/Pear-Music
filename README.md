# Pear-Music

## Description
-Motivated to build a project with classmates, we created an application utilizing the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that we had learned in the past couple of months.
-We built the Pear-Music app for users to be able to search the top songs for a specific genre. In addition to searching for music, users are able to create their own master playlist as well!
-We as a group took the first steps into real world coding experience! It was an excellent opportunity to experience a real working project using GitHub and having multiple people committing changes.


## Usage
-Load the Pear-Music website.
-Type a genre you are interested in to find the top songs in that genre.
-Click "Recommend Music" once you have filled in a genre.
-You can click on the returned tracks to learn a bio of the artist.
-Click "Add to Playlist" to start building your master list!
